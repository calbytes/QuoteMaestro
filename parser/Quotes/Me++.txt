The more we depend upon networks, the more tightly and dynamically interwoven our destinies become.

(
Depending upon our relationships to the associated social and political structures, each of us can potentialy play many different roles (some strong, some weak) at nodes within these complexes--owner, authorized user, operator, occupant, occupier, tenant, customer, guest, sojourner, tourist, immigrant, alien, interloper, infiltrator, trespasser, snooper, besieger, cracker, hijacker, invader, gatekeeper, jailer, or prisoner. Power and political identity have become inseparable from these roles.

More recently, the unbelievably intricate diagram of Internet interconnectivity has become the most vivid icon of globalization.

And my online world, which once consisted of ephemeral and disconnected fragments, has become increasingly pesistent, interconnected, and unified; it's there again, pretty much as I left it, whenever I log in again from a new locatin. The constants in my world are no longer provided by a contiguous home turf: increasingly, my sense of continuity and belonging derives from being electronically networked to the widely scattered people and places I care about.

The open source strategy--most vividly illustrated by the development of the Linux operating system--takes advantage of the creativity and enlightened self-interest of user communities to create shared intellectual capital.

So the emerging, characteristic pattern of twenty-first-century work is not that of telecommuting, as many futurists had once confidently predicted; it is that of the mobile worker who appropriates multiple, diverse sites as workplaces.

Scholars who can rely upon online resources are highly mobile and can work effectively on the road, but their colleagues who need access to undigitized print material or precious original manuscripts are still tied to traditional scholarly sites and practices.

{
The simplest way to crash a network is to block or sever a crucial link... links [...] are of such strategic importance; break them, and you disconnect large chunks of network, on either side, from each other.
}

{
It is even more effective, in general, to shut down a node - particularly one at which many links converge; Nodes often concentrate more crucial functionality than links. Sever a vein, and you may survive, but stop your heart and you're a goner. Yank a cable at the periphery of a LAN and most of the network continues to function, but crash the central server and the whole network goes down.

But in a networked world, foes are sometimes shadowy, spatially dispersed, and mobile.

After September 11, 2001, the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) set up an Information Awareness Office headed by the scary sppok John Poindexter. The IAO's publicly announced plans were to build a vast warehouse of personal data about individuals and to apply data-mining and pattern-recognition techniques to sniff out suspicious patterns of activity and electronically identify enemies.

'Scienta est Potentia' - Knowledge is Power.
Indeed. But without vigorous, critical scrutiny of such power, there will be no clear boundary between protective and repressive uses of electronic surveillance and access control technologies. Communication networks are meant to be liberating, but they can also be used to construct personalized logic prisons for all of us.

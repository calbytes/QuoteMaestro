'Always off somewhere, yes,' said Howard genially, but it did not seem to him that he travelled so very much, though when he did it was more and further than he wished. He thought of his own father again - compared to him, Howard was Phileas Fogg. Travel had seemed the key to the kingdom, back then. One dreamed of a life that would enable travel. Howard looked though his window at a lamp-post buried to its waist in snow supporting two chained-up, frozen bikes, identifiable only by the tips of their handlebars. He imagined waking up this morning and digging his bike out of the snow and riding to a proper job, the kind Belseys had had for generations, and found he couldn't imagine it. This interested Howard, for a moment: the idea that he could no longer gauge the luxuries of his own life.

Aside from her money, the guy seemed barely concerned with her, neither as a person nor as an idea. He did not call Kiki 'sister', make any assumptions or take any liberties. Obscurely disappointed, as we sometimes are when the things we profess to dislike don't happen, she looked up abruptly and smiled at him.'You're from Africa?' she asked sweetly, and picked up a charm bracelet with tiny replicas of international totems hanging from it: the Eiffel Tower, the Leaning Tower of Pisa, the Statue of Liberty. } -pg 48

As the Belsey taxi passed by a nightclub, Jerome squinted after the many girls in few clothes lining up before it, like the tail of something marvellous that did not exist. Jerome turned away. It hurts to look at what you can't have.

How old is this boy, carl wondered. And where'd he learn that you just ask some strange brother you never seen before in your life if you can listen to his Discman? Carl had figured a year ago that if he started going to events like this he would meet the kind of people he didn't usually meet - couldn't have been more right about that one.

Sometimes you get a flash of what you look like to other people. This one was unpleasant: a black woman in a headwrap, approaching with a bottle in one hand and a plate of food in the other, like a maid in an old movie. The real staff - Monique, and an unnamed friend of hers who was meant to be handing out drinks - nowhere to be seen. The living room revealed only one other person, Meredith, a fat and pretty Japanese-American girl, constant - you assumed platonic - companion of Christian. She had an extraordinary outfit on and her back to the room, engrossed in reading the spins of Howard's art books on the opposite wall. Kiki was reminded that, although Howard's fan club within the university was extremely small, it had an intensity in inverse proportion to its size.

A few minutes later, by the doors into the kitchen, Howard spotted his unsublte daughter hovering by a trio of philosophy graduates. He hurried over to effect her entry into this circle.

'God, he was right here. God. He's around here some place... God, where is he?' It was an ailment Zora inherited from her father: when confronted with people she knew to be religious she began to blaspheme wildly. The three guests stood patiently around her, watching Zora's fireworks of anxiety.

[Caroline] was an extremely wiry black woman, really one muscle from head to toe, and always immaculate - that East Coast moneyed finesse translated into blackness, her hair straight and stiff, her Chanel suit slightly brighter and more shapely than those of her white counterparts. She was one of the few women in circle whom Howard had not imagined in a sexual context - this fact was unrelated to her attractiveness (Howard often considered the most awful-looking women in this dimension). It was rather a question of impenetrability: there was no way for the imagination to get through the powerful casing of Caroline herself. You had to imagine yourself into a different universe to imagine fucking her; and that would not be how it went anyway - she would fuck you. She was infamously proud (most women disliked her) and, like any wife of a superficially attentive man, she was admirably self-contained, apparently without external social needs. But Erskine was also helplessly unfaithful, which gave the pride a characterful, impressive edge of which Howard had always been slightly in awe. She expressed herself eccentrically - she referred to Erskine's girls imperiously as those mulattos - and gave no clue as to her real feelings. A celebrated lawyer, she was, it was said, extremely close to becoming a Supreme Court judge; she knew Powell personally, and Rice; she liked to explain patiently to Howard that such people 'lifted the race'. Monty was exactly to her taste. Her delicate manicured hand was presently making precise cutting movements in the air in front of him, maybe describing where the buck stopped, or how far there was left to go.

I think public intellectuals are incredibly weird and interesting... It's got to be a kind of pathological tension, and then he has the race thing to contend with... But I just adore his dapperness. He's teribbly dapper.

They sat in silence for a few minutes, with the fan doing its useful work. Then, remotely, the television was roused. Kiki watched, but could not hear, a wild gang of raggedy boys, in the hand-me-down sportswear of wealthier countries than their own, career down a tropical back alley. Halfway between a tribal dance and a riot. They punched their fists in the air and seemed to sing. The next shot was of another boy, hurling a simple home-made firebomb. The camera followed its trajectory, showed the explosion rocking and empty army jeep, which had itself already collided with a palm tree. The channel changed once, twice. Zora settled on the weather: a five-day forecast that showed the numbers plummeting, steadily but severly. This told Kiki exactly how long she had left to wait. By next Sunday, winter would be here.

Passionately Carl denied any knowledge of these arcane arts. He was used to being feted at the Bus Stop but not in a classroom. Large sections of Carl's personality had been constructed on the founding principle that classrooms were not for Carl. 'But the grammar of it,' Claire had explained, 'is hard-wired in your brain. You're almost thinking in sonnets already. You don't need to know it to do it - but that doesn't mean you're not doing it.'

They laughed - Harry [Howard's father] still wiping tears - and walked to the front door together, continuing with these banal little English catchphrases that never failed to drive Howard up the bleeding wall. His childhood had been shot through with this meaningless noise, just so many substitutes for real conversation. Brass monkeys out there. Don't mind if I do. I don't fancy yours much. And on. And on. This was what he had been running from when he escaped to Oxford and every year since Oxford. Half-lived life. The unexamined life is not worth living. That had been Howard's callow teenage dictum. Nobody tells you, at seventeen, that examining it will be half the trouble.

It is on journeys like this - where one is so horribly misunderstood - that you find yourself longing for home, that place where you are entirely understood, for better or for worse.

Would his family be happier here? He had run from a potentially bourgeois English life straight into the arms of an actual American one - he saw that now - and, in the disappointment of the attempted escape, he had made other people's lives miserable.

She did it. She jumped off the bed and into his lap. His erection was blatant, but first she coolly drank the rest of his wine, pressing down on him as Lolita did on Humbert, as if he were just a chair she happened to sit on. No doubt she had read Lolita.

'You know... I was interested in what you were saying, back there, about it being a "demoralizing philosophy",' said Kiki, and at the same time carefully scanned the ground before her for any black ice. 'I mean, I certainly wasn't done any favours in my life - nor was my mother, nor was her mother... and nor were my children... I always gave them the opposite idea, you know? Like my mamma said to me: You gotta work five times as hard as the white girl sitting next to you. And that was sure as hell true. But I feel torn... because I've always been a supporter of affirmative action, even if I personally felt uncomfortable about it sometimes - I mean, obviously my husband has been heavily involved in it. But I was interested in the way you expressed that. It makes  you think about it again.'/n 'Opportunity,' announced Monty, 'is a right - but it is not a gift. Rights are earned. And opportunity must come through the proper channels. Otherwise the system is radically devalued.
A tree in front of them shuddered a shelf of snow from its branches on to the street. Monty held a protective arm out to stop Kiki passing. He pointed to a runnel between two ice banks, and they walked along this into the open road, only rejoining the sidewalk at the fire station./n 'But,' protested Kiki, 'isn't the whole point that here, in America - I mean I accept the situation is different in Europe - but here, in this country, that our opportunities have been severely retarded, backed up or however you want to put it, by a legacy of stolen rights - and to put that right, some allowances, concessions and support are what's needed? It's a matter of redressing the balance - because we all know it's been unbalanced a damn long time. In my mamma's neighbourhood, you could still see a segregated bus in 1973. And that's true. This stuff is close. It's recent.'/n 'As long as we encourage a culture of victimhood,' said Monty, with the rhythmic smoothness of self-quotation, 'we will continue to raise victims. And so the cycle of underachievement continues.' 
'Well,' said Kiki, holding on to a fence-post so she could hop heavily over a big puddle, 'I don't know... I just think it stinks of a kind of, well, a kind of self-hatred when we've got black folks arguing against opportunities for black folks. I mean - we don't need to be arguing among ourselves at this point. There's a war on! We got black kids dying on the front line on the other side of the world, and they're in that army 'cos they think college has got nothing to offer them. I mean, that's the reality here.'
Monty shook his head and smiled. 'Mrs Belsey - are you informing me that I am to let unqualified students into my classes to prevent them from joining the United States Army?'/n 'Call me Kiki - well, OK, maybe that's not the argument I want to pursue - but this self-hatred. When I look at Condoleezza, and Co-lin - God! I want to be sick - I see this rabid need to seperate themselves away from the rest of us - it's like "we got the oppotunity and now the quota's full and thank you very much, adios." It's that right-wing black self-hatred - I'm sorry if I offend you by saying that, but I mean... isn't that part of it? I'm not even talking politics now, I'm talking about a kind of, of of psychology.'/n They had reached the top of Wellington Hill and now heard the various church bells ring in the midday. Laid out beneath them, tucked up in its bed of snow, was one of the most peaceful, affluent, well-educated and pretty towns in America.
 'Kiki, if there's one thing I understand about you liberals, it's how much you like to be told a fairytale. You complain about creation myths - but you have a dozen of your own. Liberals never believe that conservatives are motivated by moral conviction as profoundly held as those you liberals profess yourselves to hold. You choose to believe that conservatives are motivated by a deep self-hatred, by some form of... psychological flaw. But, my dear, that's the most comforting fairytale of them all!'

Zora Belsey's real talent was not for poetry but persistence. She could dispatch three letters in an afternoon, all to the same recipient. She was the master of redial. She compiled petitions and issued ultimatums. When the city of Wellington served Zora with (in her opinion) an undeserved parking ticket, it was not Zora but the city - five months and thirty phone calls later - which backed down. In cyberspace, Zora's powers of perseverance found their truest expression.

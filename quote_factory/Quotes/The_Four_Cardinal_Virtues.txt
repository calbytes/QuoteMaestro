It is true that the classic origins of the odctrine of virtue later made Christian critics suspicious of it. They warily regarded it as too philosophical and not Scriptural enough. Thus, they preferred to talk about commandments and duties rather than about virtues.

To the contemporary mind, prudence seems less a prerequisite to goodness than an evasion of it. The statement that is prudence which makes an action good strikes us as well-nigh ridiculous. Should we hear it said, we tend to misunderstand the phrase, and take it as a tribue to undeisguised utilitariansm. For we think of prudence as far more akin to the idea of mere utility, the bonum utile, than to the ideal of nobility, the bonum honestum. In colloquial  use, prudence always carries the conootation of timorous, small-minded self-preservation, of a rather selfish concern about oneself. Neither of these traits is compatible with nobility; both are unworthy of the noble man.

Prudence is needed if man is to carry through his impulses and instincts for right acting, if he is to purify his naturally good predispositions and make them into real virtue, that is, into the truly human mode of "perfected ability."

{
Truth, then, is the prerequisite of justice. Whoever rejects truth, wheter natural or supernatural, is really "wicked" and beyond conversion. And from the realm of "natural" philosophizing, the realm which the supernatural "presupposes and perfects," we may call to mind Goethe's saying: "All laws and rules of conduct may utltimately be reduced to a single one: to truth."

Prudence, however, is not only cognition, not only knowing what is what. The prime thing is that this knowledge of reality must be transformed into the prudent decision which takes effect directly in its execution. Prudence is immediately directed toward concrete realization; hence the difference between knowledge as viewed by moral science, including "casuistic" moral science, and knowledge as viewed by prudence.
} : pg 12

{
The formal "mechanism" of that transformation of true knowledge into prudent decisions is a matter I have dealt with elsewhere. The stages of the transformation are: deliberation, judgement, decision. In the receptive-perceptive attitude of deliberation and judgement is represented the cognitive character of purdence (prudentia secundum quod est cognoscitiva), while the last stage represents the imperative character (secundum quod est praeceptiva).
} : pg 12

{
For example, the person who pluges head over heels into decision and action, without proper consideration and without well-founded judgement, is being imprudent in the mode of thoughtlessness. The phrase that comes to our minds in this connection is that of "energetic promptness," and we are not inclined to feel it as blameworthy. It is therefore well to remember that there are two ways of being "swift" and "slow": in deliberation and in action. Thomas says, as did the Greeks before him: In deliberation we may hesitate; but a considered act must be performed swiftly. Moreover, Thomas cosniders the capacity for instantly grasping an unexpected situation, and deciding with extreme quick-wittedness, to be one of the components of perfect prudence. Solertia, clear sighted objectivity in the face of the unexpected, is expressly listed in the Summa Theologica as one of the prerequisites without which prudence remains imperfect.
A second mode of imprudence is irresoluteness. It violates and ruptures at another, at the trule decisive point, the path of transformation of true knowledge into the "imperative" of prudence. It leads to deliberation and judgement tumbling uselessly into futility instead of pouring usefully into the finality of a decision. But the true "praise" of prudence lies in decision which is directed straight toward application in action.

Man's good actions take place in confrontation with reality. The goodness of concrete human action rests upton the transformation of the truth of real things; of the truth which must be won and perceived by regarding the ipsa res, reality itself.
} : pg 25

{
Human activity has two basic forms: doing (agere) and making (facer). Artifacts, technical and artistic, are the "works" of making. We ourselves are the "works" of doing.
And prudence is the perfection of the ability to make. "Art" is the "right reason" of doing (recto ratio agibilium).
} : pg 29

{
If, then, prudence is truly the mold and mother of all moral virtue, then it is likewise true that it is impossible to educate person to justice, fortitude, and temperance without first and simultaneously educating him to prudence. And education to prudence means: to objective estimation of the concrete situation of concrete activity, and to the ability to transform this cognition of reality into concrete decision.
} : pg 31

{
The rank of justice is also asserted negatively. "Among all the moral virtues it is justice wherein the use of right reason appears chiefly... hence the undue (indebitus) use of reason appears chiefly in the vices opposed to justice." The worst disruption of order in the field of things naturally human, that is, the true perversion of "human good," bears the name "injustice."
It is therefore of considerable importance that man prepare himself to encounter historical realizations of evil in which a high degree of "morality" is joined with a considerable measure of "heroism," but which nonetheless remain thoroughly and unsurpassingly inhuman and evil, because at the same time they embody uttermost injustice. We would do well to bear in mind that the uttermost perversion of mankind lies not in excess, which can be easily read in man's bearing and behavior, but in injustice, which, being essentially of the spirit, is not so readily distinguishable. We ought to be prepared to find that the most powerful embodiemtn of evil in human history, the Antichrist, might well appear in the guise of a great ascetic. This is, in fact, the almost unanimous lesson of historical thinking in the West. Whoever does not understand that it is injustice which is natural man's worst destroyer, and the reason why, will be thrown into overwhelming confusion by the experiences announced in such visions. Above all, he will be powerless to recognize the historical heralds of the abyss. For, even while he watches out in the wrong direction, the forces of destruction will establish their mastery right before his very eyes.

St. Thomas's answer might have run like this: Justice rules in a community or state whenever the three basic relations, the three fundamental structures of communal life, are disposed in their proper order: firstly, the relations of individuals to one another (ordo partium ad partes); secondly, the relations of the social whole to individuals (ordo totius ad partes); thirdly, the relations of individuals to the social whole(ordo partium ad totum). These three basic relationships correspond to the three basic forms of justice: reciprocal, or mutually exchanged justice (iustitia commutativa), which orders the relation of individual to individual partner; ministering justice (iustitia distributiva), which brings order to the relations between the community as such and the individuals who are its members; legal or general justice (iustitia legalis, iustitia generalis), which orders the members' relations to the social whole.
} : pg 72

{
Every phase of man's communal life, in the family as well as in the state, is a compromise between the interests of individuals with equal rights.

The idea that there is in distributive justice a single authority that administers the common good and that is able, by virtue of its own rights, to decide what and how much is due to me, is almost inevitably linked with that other idea of enslaving the individual and encroaching upon his rights. And at the same time a picture of "democracy" looms up alongside it as the (supposedly) only remaining alternative, which leaves no room for genuine authority and thus again veers toward despotism or has it close in its wake. In view of this literally fatal choice, it is decisive that we should recognize the ideal image of iustitia distributiva and make it a reality.
} : pg 84

In view of the objective injustice of certain laws, directives, decrees, and orders, the question naturally arises concerning the rights of resistance and nonobservance, yet never in such a form that the individual affected by those laws and regulations could appear jointly with their author before the tribunal of an independent, superior party equipped with compulsory power. In short, the person invested with the authority of the state, the man who is the subejct of iustitia distributiva, cannot actually be compelled to the just performance of his office because he himself is at one and the same time guardian and executor of distributive justice. "A ruler is installed for the purpose of guarding justice." "The pursose of power is to realize justice." What if the guardian of justice nevertheless does not guard it? Well, then, alas, there is the reign of injustice. And no appeal to any abstract arbiter such as "the conscience of manking," "the eye of the world," and "the judgement of history" can in any way change it.

In his treatise on political government Thomas asks about the suitable reward a just king can expect to receive, "since the king's duty to seek the people's good may seem too onerous a task, unless something good accrues to him for himself. It is worth contemplating, then, just what kind of suitable reward there is for a good king." Wealth, honor, and renown are mentioned, but all of them put together are considered an inadequate recompense. And when Thomas concludes this magnificent passage with the statement that the just ruler will, "as his reward, be near God and stand at His side inasmuch as he has faithfully exercised the king's divine office over his people," it means that he apportions to the good ruler an imcomparable, almost metaphysical distinction of rank, not by virtue of the religious character of his consecration, but on the grounds of his just rule. This view is further strengthened by the words then added: "Even pagan peoples had some prophetic presentiment of this when they believed the leaders and guardians of the people would be transformed into gods." It is more than arbitrary "poetic" allegory when, in his Divine Comedy, Dante sees the just kings in the constellation Aquila, fashioned in the shape of an eagle by the lights of those rulers who had been taken up into heaven.
Such formatlations are misunderstood if they are interpreted romantically. They are actually based on a highly realistic insight into the danger that usually threatens the ruler, and into the almost superhuman difficulty involved in making iustitia distributiva a reality.
} : pg 91

{
If political life is to regain its dignity, a proper appreciation of the eminence of the ruler's task and of the lofty human qualities required for it must be revived in the mind of the the public. This means the very opposite of a totalitarian glorification of power. It implies rather that an arduous and unremitting effort of education should impart to the people an incontrovertible ideal image of the requirements of man must meet if he is to exercise authority. It should, for example, be perfectly clear and self-evident to the simplest kind of thinking that wherever prudence eand justice are lacking, there can be no fitness for the proper exercise of power. In Aristotle's Politics, as well as in the Summa Theologica of Thomas Aquinas, these two cardinal virtues are called the virtues characteristic of sovereigns and rulers. yet according to the moral doctrine of the West the prudent man is certainly not merely a "tactician" able to steer an affair successfully to its conclusion. Prudence implies the kind of objectivity that lets itself be determined by reality, by insight into the facts. He is prudent who can listen in silence, who can take advice so as to gain a more precise, clear, and complete knowledge of the facts. If such a standard were applied, it would probably mean that even without formally rejecting him- in fact before there were any discussions about him - a rash, brash person, motivated by emotion or craving for power, would eo ipso be excluded from running for office, as manifestly unfit to realize the justice of rulers, iustita distributiva. For exercising this justice means, on the one hand, taking the common good into consideration and, on the other, respecting at the same time the dignity of the individual and giving him what is his due.
Up to this point we have spoken of the "ruler" or "king" as the administrator of the common good. In respect to contemporary conditions, our terminology, of course, needs to be corrected and made more precise. But even though there is no occasion in this present context to treat the different forms of government in detail, it may still be noted in passing that according to Thomas Aquinas, monarchy is the form of government which of its very nature most readily guarantees sensible administration of the common good. He also says, however, that of all the possible ways in which authority may degerate, unjust monarchy is the worst. "Just as kingly rule is the best, so is the rule of the tyrant the worst." And there is still another astonishing remark of St. Thomas to conisder, namely that tyranny arises more easily and frequently from democracy than from the rule of kings.
} : pg 92

{
If ruling is tantamount to administering the general good of everyone (a notion which is formally denied, for instance, in a concept like the "dictatorship of the proletariat"), then the way in which democracy functions imposes the following tremendous moral burden upon the individuals, voters and delegates alike: the individual is obligated by an ideal image of just distriubtion without ceasing to be interested in his own particular right. The main problem facing modern party democracy is: How can a party still be impartial?

If the specific character of fortitude consists in suffering injuries in the battle for the realization of the good, then the brave man must first know what the good is, and he must be brave for the sake of the good. "It is for the sake of the good that the brave man exposes himself to the danger of death." "In overcoming danger, fortitude seeks not danger itself, but the realization of rational good." "To take death upon oneself is not in itself praiseworthy, but solely because of its subordination to good." It is not the injurty that matters primarily, but the realization of the good.
Therefore fortitude, though it puts man to the severest test, is not the first and greatest of the virtues. For neither difficulty nor effort causes virtue, but the good alone.
Fortitude therefore points to something prior. Essentially it is something secondary, subordinate, deriving its measure from something else. It has its place in a scale of meaning and value where it does not rank first. Fortitude is not independent, it does not stand by itself. It receives its proper significance only in relation to something other than itself.
"Fortitude must not trust itself," says Ambrose.
} : pg 122

{
Every child knows that in the list of cardinal virtues fortitude comes third. This enumeration is not accidental: it is a meaningfully graded series.
Prudence and justice preced fortitude. And that means, categorically: without prudence, without justice, there is no fortitude; only he who is just and prudent can also be brave; to be really brave is quite impossible without at the same time being prudent and just also.
Nor is it possible to discuss the nature of fortitude without examining its relation to prudence and justice.
} : pg 122

Thomas Aquinas gives the following explanation for the hierarchy of the cardinal virtues: the actual good of man is his self-realization in accordance with reason, that is, in accordance with the truth of real things. (Let us keep in mind that for the classical theology of the Church, reason always and only means the "passage" to reality. We must avoid the temptation of transferring our justifiably contemptuous lack of confidence in the dictatorial "reason" of the idealist philosophers of the nineteenth centeruy to the ratio of scholasticism, always closely related to reality.) The essence of this "good of reason" is conferred in the directive cognition of prudence. In the virtue of justice, this good of reason becomes transformed into actual existence. "It is the function of justice to carry out the order of reason in all human affairs." The other virtues - fortitude and temperance - serve the conservation of this good; it is their function to preserve man from declingin from the good. Among these two latter virtues, fortitude takes precedence.
Under the direction of prudence, the good of man becomes compellingly evident. Just primarily brings about the actual realization of good. But fortitude protects this realization or clears the road for it.
} : pg 124

{
Without the "just cause" there is no fortitude. "Not the injury, but teh cause makes martyrs," says St. Augustine. "Man does not expose his life to martal danger, except to maintain justice. Therefor the praise of fortitude depends upon justice," says St. Thomas. And in the Book of Duties, St. Ambrose says: "Fortitude without justice is a lever of evil."
} : pg 125

{
To be brave is not the same as to have no fear. Indeed, fortitude actually rules out a certain kind of fearlessness, namely the sort of fearlessness that is based upon a false appraisal and evaluation of reality. Such fearlessness is either blind and deaf to real danger, or else it is the result of a perversion of love. For fear and love depend upon each other: a person who does not love, does not fear either, and he who loves falsely, fears falsely. One who has lost the will to live does not fear death. But this indifference to life is far removed from genuine fortitude; it is, indeed, an inversion of the natural order. Fortitude recognizes, acknowledges, and maintains the natural order of things. The brave man is not deluded: he sees that the injury he suffers is an evil. He does not undervalue and falsify reality; he "likes the taste" of reality as it is, real; he does not love death nor does he despise life. Fortitude presupposes in a certain sense that man is afraid of evil; its essence lies not in knowing no fear, but in not allowing oneself to be forced into evil by fear, or to be kept by fear from the realization of good.
} : pg 126

{
Fortitude consequently does not mean mere fearlessness. That man alone is brave who cannot be forced, throu fear of transitory and lesser evils, to give up the greater and actual good, and thereby bring upon himself that which is ultimately and absolutely dreadful. This fear of the ultimately dreadful belongs, as the "reverse" of the love of God, to the absolutely necessary foundations of fortitude (and of all virtue): "he who feareth the Lord will tremble and nothing"
} : pg 127

{
Rather, the destructiveness lies in the fact that unchastity constricts man and thus renders him incapable of seeing objective reality. An unchaste man wants above all something for himself; he is distracted by an unobjective "interest"; his constantly strained will-to-pleasure prevents him from confronting reality with that selfless detachment which alone makes genuine knowledge possible. St. Thomas here uses the comparison of a lion who, at the sight of a stag, is unable to perceive anything but the anticipated meal. In an unchaste heart, attention is not merely fixed upon a certain track, but the "window" of the soul has lost its "transparency," that is, its capacity for perceiving existence, as if a selfish interest had covered it, as it were, with a film of dust. (We cannot repeat too often: only he who is silent hears, only the invisible is transparent.)
} : pg 161

"Man's good is rational good. But this good is possessed in its essence by prudence, which is the perfection of reason. But justice is the agent which makes this good real. It is the portion of justice to establish in all human affairs the order of reason. But the other virtues maintain and protect this good, insofar as they order the passions, lest these turn man away from rational good. In the hierarchy of these virtues fortitude has the first place. it is followed by temperance. That which concerns being is higher than that which concerns operation; and this again is higher than that which concerns maintenance and protection, inasmuch as only that which hinders is removed. Consequently, among the cardinal virtues prudence is the noblest; justice is the second, fortitude the third, temperantia the fourth." "Justice and fortitude are higher virtues than temperance; but they are all exceeded by prudence and the theological virtues."
} : pg 174


{
Temperantia in its strict and ultimate sense is not "realization" of the good. Discipline, moderation, chastity, do not in themselves constitutde the perfection of man. By preserving and defending order in man himself, temperantia creates the indispensable prerequisite for both the realization of actual good and the actual movement of man towards his goal. Without it, the stream of the innermost human will-to-be would overflow destructively beyond all bounds, it would lose its direction and never reach the sea of perfection. Yet temperantia is not itself the stream. But it is the shore, the banks, from whose solidity the stream receives the gift of straight unhindered course, of force, descent, and velocity.

Nothing lights the way to proper understanding of humility more tellingly than this: humility and high-mindedness not only are not mutually exclusive, but actually are neighbors and akin; and both are equally opposed to either pride or pusillanimity.
What is meant by high-mindedness or magnanimity? It is the striving of the mind toward great things. High-minded is the man who feels the potentiality of greatness and prepares for it. The high-minded or magnanimous man is, in a certain sense, "selective." He will not be accessible to every approach, but will keep himself for the greatness to which he feels akin. Above all, high-mindedness is demanding as to honor: "The high-minded man strives toward that which deservews the highest honor." In the Summa Theologica we read: "If man should despise honor to the extent that he would not take care to do what is deserving of honor, this would be blameworthy." On the other hand, the high-minded man is notcrushed by dishonor; he disregards it as something beneath him. The high-minded man despises everything small-minded. He would never prize another man so highly as to do anything improper for his sake. The words of the Psalmists (Psalm 14, 4), "The evil-doer is nothing in his sight," refer to the highminded "contempt of men" of the just, says St. Thomas. Fearless frankness is the hallmark of high-mindedness; nothing is further from it than to suppress truth from fear. Flattery and dissimulation are equally removed from the high-minded. The high-minded man does not complain; for his heart is impervious to external evil. High-mindedness implies an unshakeable firmness of hope, an eactually challenging assurance, and the perfect peace of a fearless heart. The high-minded man bows neither to confusion of the soul, nor to any man, nor to fate - but to God alone.

But no man can presume on his own to point to any providential happening of the here and now, and to say: "God has manifested His intention in this or that reward or punishment, confirmation or rejection." This temptation to unveil God's inscrutability for tangible everyday use, thereby negating it, is concealed under a thousand disguises and is equally close and perilous for the most profound as for the most superficial minds.

It reaches the extremes of its desstructive and eradicating power when it builds itself a world according to its own image and likeness: when it surrounds itself with the restlessness of a perpetual moving picture of meaningless shows, and with the literally deafening noise of impressions and sensations breathlessly rushing past the windows of the senses. Behind the flimsy pomp of its facade dwells absolute nothingness; it is a world of, at most, ephemeral creations, which often within less than a quarter hour become stale and discarded, like a newspaper or magazine swiftly scanned or merely perused; a world which, to the piercing eye of the healthy mind untouched by its contagion, appears like the amusement quarter of a big city in the hard brightness of a winter morning: desperately bare, disonsolate, and ghostly.
The destructiveness of this disorder which originates from, and grows upone, obsessive addiction, lies in the fact that it stifles man's primitive power of perceiving reality; that it makes man incapable onot only of coming to himself but also of reaching reality and truth.
If such an illusory world threatens to overgrow and smother the world of real things, then to restrain the natrual wish to see takes on the character of a measure of self-protection and self-defense. Studiositas, in this fram of reference, primarily signifies that man should oppose this virutally inescapable seduction with all the force of selfless self-preservation; that he should hermetcially close the inner room of his being against the instrusively boisterous pseudo-reality of empty shows and sounds. It is in such an asceticism of cognition alone that he may preserve or regain that which actually constitutes man's vital existence: the perception of the reality of God and His creation, and the possibility of shaping himself and the world according to this truth, which reveals itself only in silence.

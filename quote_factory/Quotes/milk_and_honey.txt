trying to convince myself
i am allowed
to take up space
is like writing with
my left hand
when i was born
to use my right

-the idea of shrinking is hereditary
} : pg 29

{
father. you always call to say nothing in particular. you
ask what i'm doing or where i am and when the silence
stretches like a lifetime between us i scramble to find
questions to keep the conversation going. what i long to
say most is. i understand this world broke you. it has been
so hard on your feet. i don't blame you for not knowing
how to remain soft with me. sometimes i stay up thinking
of all the places you are hurting which you'll never care
to mention. i come from the same aching blood. from the
same bone so desperate for attention i collapse in on 
myself. i am your daughter. i know the small talk is the
only way you know how to tell me you love me. cause it
is the only way i know how to tell you.

{
you are the faint line
between faith and
blindly waiting

-letter to my future lover
} : pg 52

{
he placed his hands
on my mind
before reaching
for my waist
my hips
or my lips
he didn't call me
beautiful first
he called me
exquisite

-how he touches me
} : pg 54

{
love will come
and when love comes
love will hold you
love will call your name
and you will melt
sometimes though
love will hurt you but
love will never mean to
love will play no games
cause love knows life
has been hard enough already
} : pg 60

{
you said. if it is meant to be. fate will bring us back
together. for a second i wonder if you are really
that naive. if you really believe fate works like
that. as if it lives in the sky staring down at us. as
if it has five fingers and spends its time placing us
like pieces of chess. as if it is not the choices we
make. who taught you that. tell me. who
convinced you. you've been given a heart and
a mind that isn't yours to use. that your actions
do not define what will become of you. i want to
scream and shout it's us you fool. we're the only
ones that can bring us back together. but
instead i sit quietly. smiling softly through
quivering lips thinking. isn't it such a tragic thing.
when you can see it so clearly but the other person
doesn't.

don't mistake
salt for sugar
if he wants to
be with you
he will
it's that simple
} : pg 85

{
you were temptingly beautiful
but stung when i got close
} : pg 87

{
i didn't leave because
i stopped loving you
i left because the longer
i stayed the less
i loved myself

you mustn't have to
make them want you
they must want you themselves

if
he can't help but
degrade other women
when they're not looking
if toxicity is central
to his language
he could hold you
in his lap and be soft
honey
that man could feed you sugar and
douse you in rose water
but that still could not
make hims sweet

-if you want to know the type of man he is

{
i am a museum full of art
but you had your eyes shut
} : pg 100

{
you must have known
you were wrong
when your fingers
were dipped inside me
searching for honey that
would not come for you
} : pg 101

{
you treat them like they
have a heart like yours
but not everyone can be as
soft and as tender

you don't see the
person they are
you see the person
they have the potential to be

you give and give till
they pull everything out of you
and leave you empty
} : pg 106

{
i had to leave
i was tired of
allowing you to
make me feel
anything less
than whole

the abused
and the
abuser

-i have been both
} : pg 111

{
it wasn't you i was kissing
-dont be mistaken

it was him on my mind
your lips were just convenient
} : pg 113

{
i will not have you
build me into your life
when
what i want is to
build a life with you

-the difference
} : pg 117

{
you are snakeskin
and i keep shedding you somehow
my mind is forgetting
every exquisite detail
of your face
the letting go has
become the forgetting
which is the most
pleasant and saddest thing
to have happened
} : pg 119

{
what i miss most is how you loved me. but what i didn't
know was how you loved me had so much to do with
the person i was. it was a reflection of everything i gave
to you. coming back to me. how did i not see that. how.
did i sit here soaking in the idea that no one else would
love me that way. when it was i that taught you. when it
was i that showed you how to fill. the way i needed to be
filled. how cruel i was to myself. giving you credit for my
warmth simply because you had felt it. thinking it was
you who gave me strength. wit. beauty. simply because
you recognized it. as if i was already not these things
before i met you. as if i did not remain all these once you
left.

grow flowers out of mine so
bloom beautifully
dangersously
loudly

however you need
just bloom

i thank the universe
for taking
everything it has taken
and giving to me
everything it is giving

-balance

{
sometimes
the apology
never comes
when it is wanted

and when it comes
it is neither wanted
nor needed

-you are too late

{
to be
soft
is
to be
powerful
} : pg 166

{
i know it's hard
believe me
i know it feels like
tomorrow will never come
and today will be the most
difficult day to get through
but i swear you will get through
the hurt will pass
as it always does
if you give it time and
let it so let it
go
slowly
like a broken promise
let it go
} : pg 168

{
my issue with what they consider beautiful
is their concept of beauty
centers around excluding people
i find hair beautiful
when a woman wears it
like a garden on her skin
that is the definition of beauty
big hooked noses
pointing upward to the sky
like they're rising
to the occasion
skin the color of earth
my ancestors planted crops on
to feed a lineage of women with
thighs thick as tree trunks
eyes like almonds
deeply hooded with conviction
the rivers of punjab
flow through my bloodstream so
don't tell me my women
aren't as beautiful
as the ones in
your country

to them
you must be kindest

you must
want to spend
the rest of your life
with yourself
first
} : pg 198

{
your art is not about how many people
like your work
your art
is about
if your heart likes your work
if your soul likes your work
it's about how honest
you are with yourself
and you
must never
trade honestly
for relatability

give to those
who have nothing

you split me open
in the most honest
way there is
to split a soul open
and forced me to write
at a time i was sure i
could not write again

-thank you
